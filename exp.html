<p><center><i>Every travel tale has something special, I was very happy with my last vacation & would like to share my experience that I had with my stay which was booked from Reinvent-Travel. Me being a foodie, I would like to share the taste of food that I had during this stay. 

To start with... This stay we booked just did not include the stay but also included a free breakfast with all the conveniences to order food for Lunch/Snacks/Meals as per our requirement & was definitely a home made food which we could feel in every bite. </i></center></p>
